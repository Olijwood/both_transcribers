there is initiates i saw that so spotty has may be incorrectly but over fifty million songs tracks and over three billion playlist so yes amillion songs in three billion playlist sixty times more laliswayo make of that yes so the way i think about it as that from this that the station of machine union of you you have all these  anything about reinforcement leaning prateapace all the tracks and you can take different journeys through this through this world and this i think of the sins like people helping themselves and each other creating interesting letters through the space of tracks and then it also surprising that across your many tens of millions of economic units there will be billions of paths that makes sense and were probably pretty quite far away from having found all of them so kind of our junior when was purified started it was really a search book tawas for the time pretty powerful and then i like to refer to the disproving language called plain listing where if you as you polly were pretty good at music you knew you knew releases you know your back at longyester with the heaven you could create a sancho yourself using this plaything to a less like met apron anguish from music to sound agile and people who were good at musick to how do you call the product for people who are good at music that was in actual enough if you had the cat long and a good search too he can create your own sessions you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life probably perfectly personal because you did it yourself but the problem was most people many people are in that good at music they just can't spend the time even if he very good at nessessarie up so well we did to try to scale this was too essentially tried to build you can think of them as agents that this this friend that some people had that helped them navigate this music catlett's or were trying to do for you also there is something like a million active use apafi the to you for the machine learning perspective the two hundred million people plus the creating is really interesting to think of a play lists as men are of you meant it that way but some mistake a programming language its a trace of exploration of those individual agents of the listeners and ye have all this new tracks coming in says the fascinating space that is ripe for a chilean ing so that is there is there is a possible how can play list be used as data in terms of machine learning in just the house botafogo the music so we found in our data not surprising that people who play listed lots they retain much better they had a great experience and so are first attempt was to play lessor users and so we acquire this company called to negation professional play lesters and comelier the maximum of over human intelligence to help to help build licensers through the tracks pace for four people and that broaden the product then the obvious next and we you know we used to fistical means where they could see what when they create a playless how did applause you know they could see skip of the songs they could see at the somber or in the manly it ready to play lest the maximus performance for a large group of people but there were never enough editors to play list for you personally to the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personally station using editors and tools and statistics to individualisation and then what so interesting about that the three billion plaintive as we ended the truth is beluchi was not strategy as is often the case it looks really smart and inside was as dumb like we looked at the play lasts and we had some people in the company of parsing their grammar is really good machine learning already back in in back then like two thousand seven two thousand eight the back then he was most collaborative continueth but merely that what this is people are grouping tracks for themselves that have some semantic meaning to them and then they actually label it with a playlist name as well so in a sense people were looping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them as so could you could you use that information to find that that latent and tatting and so we started playing around with claretie filtering and we thought tremendous success with him basically trying to extract some of these some of these dimensions and envy think about is not surprising at all it be quite surprising if planless were actually ran them if they had no semantic meaning for for most people the group these tracks for some reason so we just happened cross the incredible date set for people at taking taken these tensions of tracks and group them along different mantic nectar in the semantics being outside the individual uses at some kind of universal there is a universal embedding that holds cross people on the eyes do think that the betting to find and be reflective of the people who play lesson so if if you have a lot of indeavoured can perform that there by all we found was that yes there were these the latinities they were very powerful and we we had them it was interesting because i think that the people who planlessly worthies called music of his anathoth really into music and they often had a certain their taste was of those often surged the second pause and so what surprised us if if you look at the problem from the outside you might expect that the algorithm would start performing best with mainstream first because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste then really particular taste was the complete opposite for us the recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as having very unique taste has probably because all of them play less than and they didn't panaetius they actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox so we had the complete opposite of more expected success within the hardest problem first and then had to truesdale to more instruction
